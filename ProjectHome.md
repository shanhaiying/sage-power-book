This is a book about Sage http://sagemath.org, which is a large free open source
software program for computational mathematical.

The audience of this book is undergraduates learning Sage and Python, who have
previous computer programming experience and want to write fast powerful programs
and really understand their tools. The author strongly believes people should learn to
deeply understand their tools. This is a big motivation for open source in the rst place,
and also a theme of the book. This book is also far from self contained, and the reader
will be repeatedly pointed to other specic tutorials and reference materials.
